    "# Features of Python\n",
    "**Easy-to-learn −** Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. <br>\n",
    "**Easy-to-read −** Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.<br>\n",
    "**Easy-to-maintain −** Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.<br>\n",
    "**A broad standard library −** Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.<br>\n",
    "**Interactive Mode −** Python has support for an interactive mode that allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.<br>\n",
    "**Portable −** Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.<br>\n",
    "**Extendable −** You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.<br>\n",
    "**Databases −** Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.<br>\n",
    "**GUI Programming −** Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries, and Windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.<br>\n",
    "**Scalable −** Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.,br>"

    "# Why Python?\n",
    "* Python is **open source**, which means it's available free of cost.\n",
    "* Python is **simple** and so **easy to learn**.\n",
    "* Python is **versatile** and can be used to create many different things.\n",
    "* Python has **powerful development libraries**, including AI, ML, etc.\n",
    "* Python is **much in demand** and ensures a **high salary**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Python is Interpreted −** Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it.\n",
    "* **Python is Interactive −** You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.\n",
    "* **Python is Object-Oriented −** Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.\n",
    "* **Python is a Beginner's Language −** Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games."
